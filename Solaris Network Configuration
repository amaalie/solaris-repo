Introducion a Solaris Server to the Network 
_______________________________________________________
**** 1.	Hostname Change ****
Files involved:
/etc/nodename
/etc/hostname.e1000g0 (e1000g0 = NIC label info)
/etc/hosts
a.	Display the current hostname of the system 
#hostname
or 
#uname -n
b.	Add the new hostname into the file /etc/nodename
(The /etc directory stores system configuration files)
#echo “testServer” > /etc/nodename
#cat /etc/nodename  (to verify)

c.	Add the new hostname into the file /etc/hostname.e1000g0
#echo testServer > /etc/hostname.e1000g0
#cat /etc/hostname.e1000g0 (to verify)

d.	Add the new hostname into the file /etc/hosts
/etc/hosts is used to store A records (/etc/host acted like dns and also was there before dns came in the late 80s)
#cat /etc/hosts

Static IP = x.x.x.242
#vi /etc/hosts (and add your A record as follows
10.0.0.242 testServer

e.	Replace the hostname cached in RAM with the new Hostname 
#hostname testServer
Or 
#reboot
#hostname (to verify) 

summary:
When i change the hostname of a solaris server, I have to add the new hostname to to three (3) files  /etc/nodename, /etc/hostname.e1000g0, /etc/hosts then i will use the hostname command to replace the old hostname cached in the RAM with new hostname.


**** 2.	Default Gateway configuration in Solaris ****
File involved;
/etc/defaultrouter
#echo 10.0.0.1 > /etc/defaultrouter 
#cat /etc/defaultrouter (to verify)
Or 
Display the default gateway of the system
#cat /etc/defaultrouter 

 

**** 3.	DNS Configuration in Solaris ****
Files Involved;
/etc/resolv.conf
/etc/nsswitch.conf
Display the current DNS settings of the server 
#cat /etc/resolv.conf
Replace the current DNS servers  to; 
8.8.8.8
8.8.4.4

#echo “nameserver 8.8.8.8” > /etc/resolv.conf
#echo “nameserver 8.8.4.4” >> /etc/resolv.conf
#cat /etc/resolv.conf (verify)
 
#more /etc/nsswitch.conf
Lines Involved;
hosts: files dns
Ipnodes: files dns
#vi /etc/nsswitch.conf (and clean up the DHCP entries)


**** 4.	Assign A static IP address to your Server ****
x.x.x.242
A)	Display the current IP address of the system 
#ifconfig -a

B)	Switch the server IP configuration from DHCP to Static
#rm /etc/dhcp.e1000g0
The existence of this file in the system means it is configured for dynamic. The absence of the of the file means the system is configured for static
#find /etc/ -name dhcp.e1000g0
#rm /etc/dhcp.e1000g0
#ls /etc/dhcp.e1000g0
Assign the static IP to your system 
#ifconfig e1000g0 inet 10.0.0.242/24 up
#ifconfig -a    (to verify)
 

Double check if IP address is consistent with /etc/hosts 
#vi /etc/hosts (and make sure the IP of the server is consistent with that in the /etc/hosts
#cat /etc/hosts
#vi /etc/hosts and adjust your IP to match
